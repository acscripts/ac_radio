## ONLY FOR USE WITH OX CORE!

### Introduction
This branch of ac_radio is modified to work only with [ox_core](https://github.com/overextended/ox_core) and [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) installed.  
The main reason for this is that I don't want to support old and poorly written frameworks like ESX or QB-Core.

If you're already using ac_radio with ox_core, I highly recommend that you to switch to this version, as it is much more optimised and written specifically to work with ox_core.  
It will also recieve updates and bug fixes much faster than the main branch.
